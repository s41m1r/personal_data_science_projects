"# Background_x000D_
_x000D_
I had first added these changes into a separate commit on https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/35390. _x000D_
_x000D_
Was encouraged by @georgeclaghorn [in this comment](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/35390#discussion_r259695792) to open a separate PR for this change. _x000D_
_x000D_
# Overview_x000D_
_x000D_
Consider a model with `One` and `Many` attachments configured:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
class User < ActiveRecord::Base_x000D_
  has_one_attached :avatar_x000D_
  has_many_attached :highlights_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
### One Attachment_x000D_
_x000D_
After attaching `One` attachment (`:avatar`), we can see that the associated_x000D_
`_blob` record (`:avatar_blob`) still returns as `nil`._x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
user.avatar.attach(blob)_x000D_
user.avatar_attachment.present?  => true_x000D_
user.avatar_blob.present?        => false    # Incorrect!_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
This is a false negative. It happens because after the attachment and blob_x000D_
are built:_x000D_
_x000D_
  1. The record already has its `_blob` association loaded, as `nil`_x000D_
  2. the `::Attachment` is associated with the record but the `::Blob` only gets_x000D_
    associated with the `::Attachment`, not the record itself_x000D_
_x000D_
In reality, the blob does in fact exist. We can verify this as follows:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
user.avatar.attach(blob)_x000D_
user.avatar_attachment.blob.present?    => true  # Blob does exist!_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
The fix in this change is to simply assign the `::Blob` when assigning_x000D_
the `::Attachment`. After this fix is applied, we correctly observe:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
user.avatar.attach(blob)_x000D_
user.avatar_attachment.present?  => true_x000D_
user.avatar_blob.present?        => true    # Woohoo!_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
### Many Attachments_x000D_
_x000D_
We don't see this issue with `Many` attachments because the `_blob` association_x000D_
is already loaded as part of attaching more/newer blobs._x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
user.highlights.attach(blob)_x000D_
user.highlights_attachments.any?    => true_x000D_
user.highlights_blobs.any?          => true_x000D_

_x000D_
This PR first renames the existing `inspect` implementation to `short_identifier`. This improves the 👀 reading of `identifier_method_name`, which used to read `inspect.tr(""^a-z_"", ""_"")`, which is a bit awkward because it relies on what `inspect` _happens_ to return. `short_identifier.tr(""^a-z_"", ""_"")` conveys what it does better (and allows us to change `inspect` 🎉 )._x000D_
_x000D_
Inspect used to return a string like `app/views/home/index.html.erb`, which is confusing because I would normally expect to see a type and it isn't immediately obvious that that isn't a string, particularly when in an array (ie. `[some/template, another/template]` parses to me the same as `[""some/template"", ""another/template""]` on first glance)._x000D_

```_x000D_
_x000D_
Including the class name makes it look more like most `#inspect` methods. I also added `locals` to this output because it's often different for the same identifier (we need to compile each set of locals separately). It _could_ be helpful to include handler, formats, and variants, but they should be inferable by the developer from the identifier, so I didn't include them._x000D_

#34505 introduced the ability to block writes even if the database allows it. It added a `READ_QUERY` regex to help determine if a query was a read or a write.

Wait until initialization has completed before we assign `config.action_mailer` to `ActionMailer::Base`._x000D_
_x000D_
Eager loading of `app/mailers` must also be disabled._x000D_
_x000D_
### Other Information_x000D_
_x000D_
The ActionMailer railtie looks at `config.action_mailer` and assigns these options to `ActionMailer::Base`. However, it was previously doing so as soon as soon as `ActionMailer` was loaded (`ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_mailer)`)._x000D_
_x000D_
We now wait for initialization to complete (`ActiveSupport.on_load(:after_initialize)`) _as well_ as the `ActionMailer` being loaded._x000D_
_x000D_
This is an important change because `ActionMailer` (and its config) is explicitly designed to be extensible, specifically ActionMailer allows third-party gems to register additional ""delivery methods""._x000D_
_x000D_
Delivery methods can be registered with third-party Railtie by using:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
class Railtie < ::Rails::Railtie_x000D_
  initializer ""foo_mail.register_delivery_method"" do_x000D_
    ActionMailer::Base.add_delivery_method :foo, FooMailer_x000D_
  end_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
or ideally:_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
class Railtie < ::Rails::Railtie_x000D_
  initializer ""foo_mail.register_delivery_method"" do_x000D_
    ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_mailer) do_x000D_
      add_delivery_method :foo, FooMailer_x000D_
    end_x000D_
  end_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
`add_delivery_method` adds support for `ActionMailer::Base.foo_settings` and `config.action_mailer.foo_settings` (https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/delivery_methods.rb#L51)._x000D_
_x000D_
However, calling `add_delivery_method` requires `ActionMailer` to be loaded, and _prior_ to this commit, the config would already have been assigned on `ActionMailer::Base`, so there's no opportunity to do:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
config.action_mailer.foo_settings = {_x000D_
    foo_auth: 'bar'_x000D_
} _x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
If you were previously to put the above in your environment config, you'd get an error because when `ActionMailer` when `ActionMailer` is eager loaded in production, third-party gems haven't run their initializers so `undefined method 'foo_settings=' for ActionMailer::Base:Class` is raised (e.g. https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-ruby/issues/104)._x000D_
_x000D_
Instead, if you were to move your logic into `app/initializers/foo_mail.rb` e.g._x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
Rails.application.configure do_x000D_
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :foo_x000D_
  config.action_mailer.foo_settings = {_x000D_
      api_key: ENV['FOO_API_KEY'],_x000D_
      domain: ENV['FOO_DOMAIN'],_x000D_
  }_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
this _silently_ fails _in production_ (with eager loading enabled), because we're (without this PR) assigning the config _after_ `ActionMailer` has been loaded (and the config copied across), so although we've set the config it is never used and out of sync with `ActionMailer::Base`, which for example still returns `:smtp` for `ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method`, even though `Rails.application.config.action_mailer.delivery_method` correctly returns `:foo`._x000D_
_x000D_
This commit resolves the issue by ensuring we wait until all initializers have run _before_ settings up `ActionMailer::Base` with options from `action_mailer.config`._x000D_
_x000D_
We can now in `app/initializers/foo_mailer.rb` do:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_

Zeitwork uses a default inflector that’s different than ActiveSupport’s to define which modules can be autoloader based on filesystem paths. If these two inflectors disagree on the filename<->constant conversion, then the modules created for autoloading can be named one thing and the actual constants defined in those files can be named something else. Because the ActiveSupport::Inflector can be customized, it’s possible for the two inflectors to disagree. In Rails 5, only the ActiveSupport::Inflector was used to constantize, so any exceptions applied to it in an initializer or whatever would apply to the autoloader as well. If we make Zeitwork use the ActiveSupport inflector, then they should agree again, and backwards compatibility should be maintained._x000D_
_x000D_
Zeitwork supports custom inflectors and expects it's `inflector` to have a very similar interface to ActiveSupports so I am guessing this was always intended (@fxn can probably say more), but I think the question is if this should be the default or not. I think it should because it maintains backwards compatibility with the way things worked with the classic autoloader, and it allows users one more notch of control over the ""magic"" constant discovery that Rails does. _x000D_

_x000D_
This fixes #35292._x000D_
_x000D_
Basically, when passing a symbol with a dot to `pluck`, we are expecting it to be a table + a column. MySQL and PostgreSQL handled it fine, because quoting `schema + table` is the same as quoting `table + column`: `""part1"".""part2""`. So a quote_table_name was being applied by pluck._x000D_
_x000D_
However, this is not the case in SQLite3, which wants `""schema.table"".""column""` (note the schema and table in the same quotes), and so would generate `""table.column""`.

"Using the subscript method `#[]` on a string has several overloads and_x000D_
rather complex implementation. One of the overloads is the capability to_x000D_
accept a regular expression and then run a match, then return the_x000D_
receiver (if it matched) or one of the groups from the MatchData._x000D_
_x000D_
The function of the `UUID#cast` method is to cast a UUID to a type and_x000D_
format acceptable by postgres. Naturally UUIDs are supposed to be_x000D_
string and of a certain format, but it had been determined that it was_x000D_
not ideal for the framework to send just any old string to Postgres and_x000D_
allow the engine to complain when ""foobar"" or """" was sent, being_x000D_
obviously of the wrong format for a valid UUID. Therefore this code was_x000D_
written to facilitate the checking, and if it were not of the correct_x000D_
format, a `nil` would be returned as is conventional in Rails._x000D_
_x000D_
Now, the subscript method will allocate one or more strings on a match_x000D_
and return one of them, based on the index parameter. However, there_x000D_
is no need for a new string, as a UUID of the correct format is already_x000D_
such, and so long as the format was verified then the string supplied is_x000D_
adequate for consumption by the database._x000D_
_x000D_
The subscript method also creates a MatchData object which will never be_x000D_
used, and so must eventually be garbage collected._x000D_
_x000D_
Garbage collection indeed. This innocuous method tends to be called_x000D_
quite a lot, for example if the primary key of a table is a uuid, then_x000D_
this method will be called. If the foreign key of a relation is a UUID,_x000D_
once again this method is called. If that foreign key is belonging to_x000D_
a has_many relationship with dozens of objects, then again dozens of_x000D_
UUIDs shall be cast to a dup of themselves, and spawn dozens of_x000D_
MatchData objects, and so on._x000D_
_x000D_
So, for users that:_x000D_
* Use UUIDs as primary keys_x000D_
* Use Postgres_x000D_
* Operate on collections of objects_x000D_
_x000D_
This accomplishes a significant savings in total allocations, and may_x000D_
save many garbage collections._x000D_

When rendering a collection, each object in the collection can respond to `to_partial_path`.  The template renderer will render the partial returned by that method.  However, each object in the collection could return a different template.  That means there isn't *one* template associated with the collection.

"## Introduction_x000D_
_x000D_
This patch integrates [Zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk) and makes it the default autoloader for Rails 6 applications._x000D_
_x000D_
* You can now robustly use constant paths in class and module definitions:_x000D_
_x000D_
  ```ruby_x000D_
  # Matches Ruby semantics now._x000D_
  class Admin::UsersController < ApplicationController_x000D_
    # ..._x000D_
  end_x000D_
  ```_x000D_
_x000D_
* All known use cases of `require_dependency` have been eliminated._x000D_
_x000D_
* There is a [centralized solution](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk#preloading) to orderly preload STI hierarchies._x000D_
_x000D_
* Edge cases in which the autoloaded constant depended on execution order are gone._x000D_
_x000D_
* Autoloading is thread-safe in general, not just for the currently supported use cases with explicit locks like web requests. For example, you can now write multi-threaded scripts to be run by `bin/rails runner` and they will autoload just fine._x000D_
_x000D_
## Principles behind the integration_x000D_
_x000D_
The classic autoloader has been there since [the beginning](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v1.0.0/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb), and while it has [no public interface](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Dependencies.html) except for locking mechanisms, extra care has been taken:_x000D_
_x000D_
* The implementation of `ActiveSupport::Dependencies` and its test suite are untouched._x000D_
_x000D_
* Easy way to opt-out: just throw `config.autoloader = :classic` into `config/application.rb`. It has to go after `config.load_defaults 6.0` if you have that line._x000D_
_x000D_
* Integration has been clearly delineated so that falling back to the classic autoloader is safe._x000D_
_x000D_
* It is a key observation that `Kernel#autoload` is invoked by the constant resolution algorithm as classes and modules are checked. In particular, it takes precedence over `const_missing` and thus we can leave `const_missing` there to have a cleaner patch, it won't do anything anyway for autoloadable constants._x000D_
_x000D_
* Seamless take over in new apps from an end-user point of view._x000D_
_x000D_
I envision a gradual evolution of this feature, Rails 6 is just a first step._x000D_
_x000D_
## Patch overview_x000D_
_x000D_
* There is a new config attribute `config.autoloader` that can be `:classic` or `:zeitwerk`. This is `:zeitwerk` for new apps on CRuby, and `:classic` for apps loading the defaults of previous versions or run by other interpreters._x000D_
_x000D_
* If Zeitwerk is enabled, there are two globally accessible autoloaders: `Rails.autoloader`, and `Rails.once_autoloader`. The former is the main one. The latter, in addition to not win a Pulitzer for naming, is responsible for `autoload_once_paths`, and importantly also for autoload paths that come from gems. Both autoloaders autoload, but only `Rails.autoloader` is invoked by Rails to reload, so if you have engines like Action Storage or Devise installed as gems, they won't be reloaded anymore._x000D_
_x000D_
* In particular, if you throw `Rails.autoloader.logger = method(:puts)` to `config/application.rb` you'll see Zeitwerk doing its thing._x000D_
_x000D_
* Selected private API is emulated, but it is _not_ the goal of the integration to fully replicate the private API. If there is code that depends on the inner workings excessively, I prefer that people switch to `:classic` until it gets updated, to clutter the integration to support any imaginable abuse of the private API. This autoloading is an inflection point and it is our opportunity to start afresh._x000D_
_x000D_
* Furthermore, the private API called downwards from `const_missing` should not be called anymore because, as explained above, `Kernel#autoload` runs first. There might be some edge case around autoloading errors, not worth it, keep it simple._x000D_
_x000D_
* People should not write `require_dependency` anymore, and upgrades should delete the calls. If you detect a use case for it please tell us._x000D_
_x000D_
* Eager loading calls `Zeitwerk.eager_load_all`. Therefore, it will eager load not only the Rails application, but also all gems managed by Zeitwerk._x000D_
_x000D_
* Engines can technically use Zeitwerk by clearing their autoload paths, but better don't and leave the choice to the parent application._x000D_
_x000D_
* Autoload paths are frozen in the finisher. The public API for them is `config.autoload_paths`, but if existing code is pushing to `ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths`, it has to do so before the finisher. Action Mailer has been updated to do that._x000D_
_x000D_
* Applications using `bootsnap` have to upgrade to 1.4.0._x000D_
_x000D_
## Backwards incompatibility_x000D_
_x000D_
In `:classic` mode there is no change. If Zeitwerk is enabled:_x000D_
_x000D_
* For files below the standard `concerns` directories (like `app/models/concerns`), `Concerns` cannot be a namespace. That is, `app/models/concerns/geolocatable.rb` is expected to define `Geolocatable`, not `Concerns::Geolocatable`._x000D_
_x000D_
* A file should define only one constant in its namespace (but can define inner ones). So, if `app/models/foo.rb` defines `Foo` and also `Bar`, `Bar` won't be reloaded cleanly. You can have inner constants, so `Foo` may define an auxiliary internal class `Foo::Woo`._x000D_
_x000D_
* A file that defines a class or module that acts as a namespace, needs to define the class or module using the `class` and `module` keywords. For example, if you have `app/models/hotel.rb` defining the `Hotel` class, and `app/models/hotel/pricing.rb` defining a mixin for hotels, the `Hotel` class must be defined with `class`, you cannot do `Hotel = Class.new { ... }` or `Hotel = Struct.new { ... }` or anything like that. Those idioms are fine in classes and modules that do not act as namespaces._x000D_
_x000D_
* Once the application has booted, autoload paths are frozen._x000D_
_x000D_
* Autoload paths that do not exist on boot are ignored._x000D_
_x000D_
## Future work_x000D_
_x000D_
I believe the patch is in good shape for a beta. For final, I'll work on documentation. In particular, the [Autoloading and Reloading Constants](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html) needs a complete revision._x000D_
_x000D_
There are some `if RUBY_ENGINE == ""ruby""` and `config.autoloader == :zeitwerk` here and there, I'll try to encapsulate them somehow._x000D_

"Turn lookup context in to a stack, push and pop if formats change_x000D_
_x000D_
This commit keeps a stack of lookup contexts on the ActionView::Base instance.  If a format is passed to render, we instantiate a new lookup context and push it on the stack, that way any child calls to ""render"" will use the same format information as the parent.  This also isolates ""sibling"" calls to render (multiple calls to render in the same template)._x000D_

### Solution_x000D_
_x000D_
This PR introduces a temporary `NonSymbolAccessDeprecatedHash` class that recursively wraps any nested hashes inside the `OrderedOptions` object returned from `config_for` and issues a deprecation notice when a non-symbol based access is performed._x000D_
_x000D_
This way, any apps that are still relying on the ability to access these nested hashes using non-symbol keys will be able to observe the deprecation notices and have time to implement fixes before non-symbol access is removed for good._x000D_
_x000D_
### Other Information_x000D_
_x000D_
Note that the top-level access to the `OrderedOptions` object returned from `config_for` has indifferent access semantics due to the nature of how `OrderedOptions` works. This functionality is the same for `Rails.config` and `secrets`, so is not changed nor is any deprecation notice issued._x000D_
_x000D_
The deprecation is only for nested keys below the top-level, since that is the functionality that is potentially broken.","C 0000114",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

"This commit fixes the memory leak in dev.  I'm not super pleased with the commit right now and I want to refactor it some, but I also want to make sure it's public.  Specifically I dislike the part where I added another layer to the cache.  I think I can improve that part._x000D_
_x000D_
I think the source of the leak is that the digest cache was combined with the template object cache.  This commit splits the caches, then combines them behind the `DetailsKey` interface.  Resolvers have to ask the details key thing for their cache.  That gave the LookupContext an implicit dependency on `DetailsKey`, which is why I had to change the `fallbacks` method to do a check at runtime (otherwise the circular dependency ruins file loading)._x000D_

2. Uses locals as part of the ""details key"". This way we can eliminate one layer of template caches_x000D_

I had to do a `details[:locals] || locals.sort` because we have tests that directly call `find_all` on the resolver rather than going through the normal template rendering process.  Do we consider the resolver to be public API?  The class isn't really documented, so I would think ""no"".  If we do consider it public, I think we should make it private._x000D_
_x000D_
Second, I changed `Template#initialize` to [require that locals are passed in](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/43f14f02c04279a44b0de2bb76071e30d435d3bb/actionview/lib/action_view/template.rb#L139).  I found the exception to be very helpful when debugging.  Should we make it required?  Or just default to an empty array?  If we want to make it required, I'll add a deprecation warning, otherwise just default to empty array (I have no opinion about this).","C 0000135",1,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,2,0,0,0

This commit introduces a `FileTemplate` type that subclasses `Template`._x000D_
The `FileTemplate` keeps a reference to the filename, and reads the_x000D_
source from the filesystem.  This effectively makes the template source_x000D_
immutable._x000D_
_x000D_
Other classes depended on the source to be mutated while being compiled,_x000D_
so this commit also introduces a temporary way to pass the mutated_x000D_
source to the ERB (or whatever) compiler.  See `LegacyTemplate`._x000D_

"### Summary_x000D_
_x000D_
Change new Rails applications to use the ActiveJob `:test` queue adapter in the test environment. Right now the test adapter is used for test cases that inherit from ActiveJob::TestCase, but other test cases (models, controllers) currently use the default `:async` adapter._x000D_
_x000D_
The current behavior is surprising to me: if a model or controller test generates a job, that job will be performed immediately and concurrently with test execution in a different thread, with no visibility into success, failure, or side-effects generated by the job (i.e. database writes). With this change, if a test case does want enqueued jobs to execute, it can use `perform_enqueued_jobs` to run them on the main test thread in a deterministic manner._x000D_
_x000D_
Using the `:test` adapter in the test environment (in a documented and overridable way) is consistent with other Rails defaults like the ActiveStorage test service and the ActionMailer test delivery method.","C 0000154",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Allows extra client configuration options to be specified for the azure storage service in active support._x000D_
_x000D_
### Other Information_x000D_
_x000D_
When developing with azure, we often want to run a local storage emulator - maybe using microsoft's emulator or even the open source 'azurite'.  However, unlike in the S3 service - there is no way to pass extra options in the storage.yml file._x000D_
_x000D_
This change allows any extra options accepted by the azure-storage gem (such as storage_blob_host and use_path_style_uri which are useful for this setup) to also be accepted by active storage and passed on to the underlying azure-storage client_x000D_

"The following PR adds behavior to Rails to allow an application to_x000D_
automatically switch it's connection from the primary to the replica._x000D_
_x000D_
A request will be sent to the replica if:_x000D_
_x000D_
* The request is a read request (`GET` or `HEAD`)_x000D_
* AND It's been 5 seconds since the last write to the database (because_x000D_
we don't want to send a user to a replica if the write hasn't made it_x000D_
to the replica yet)_x000D_
_x000D_
A request will be sent to the primary if:_x000D_
_x000D_
* It's not a GET/HEAD request (ie is a POST, PATCH, etc)_x000D_
* Has been less than 5 seconds since the last write to the database_x000D_
_x000D_
The implementation that decides when to switch reads (the 5 seconds) is_x000D_
""safe"" to use in production but not recommended without adequate testing_x000D_
with your infrastructure. At GitHub in addition to the 5 seconds since_x000D_
last write we have a curcuit breaker that checks the replication delay_x000D_
and will send the query to a replica before the 5 seconds has passed._x000D_
This is specific to our application and therefore not something Rails_x000D_
should be doing for you. You'll need to test and implement more robust_x000D_
handling of when to switch based on your infrastructure. The auto_x000D_
switcher in Rails is meant to be a basic implementation / API that acts_x000D_
as a guide for how to implement autoswitching._x000D_
_x000D_
The impementation here is meant to be strict enough that you know how to_x000D_
implement your own resolver and operations classes but flexible enough_x000D_
that we're not telling you how to do it._x000D_
_x000D_
The middleware is not included automatically and can be installed in_x000D_
your application with the classes you want to use for the resolver and_x000D_
operations passed in. If you don't pass any classes into the middleware_x000D_
the Rails default Resolver and Session classes will be used._x000D_
_x000D_
The Resolver decides what parameters define when to_x000D_
switch, Operations sets timestamps for the Resolver to read from. For_x000D_
exmaple you may want to use cookies instead of a session so you'd_x000D_
implement a Resolver::Cookies class and pass that into the middleware_x000D_
like so:_x000D_
_x000D_
```_x000D_
config.middleware.use ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector,_x000D_
Resolver, Resolver::Cookies_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
Your classes can inherit from the existing classes and reimplement the_x000D_
methods (or implement more methods) that you need to do the switching._x000D_
You only need to implement methods that you want to change. For example_x000D_
if you wanted to set the session token for the last read from a replica_x000D_
you would reimplement the `read_from_replica` method in your resolver_x000D_
class and implement a method that updates a new timestamp in your_x000D_
operations class._x000D_

Deeply nested commands currently don't get printed properly. See https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34832#issuecomment-456070659. This should fix that by allowing `Rails::Command::Base#command_root_namespace` to include nested namespace segments, and not just the first one._x000D_
_x000D_
I tried making it so `command_root_namespace` excluded the `command_name` as well, but that didn't play nicely with method-based command definition (eg. `SecretsCommand`). The regex I use in `namespaced_commands` is probably not the best approach, any feedback here would be appreciated.","C 0000206",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"### Problem_x000D_
_x000D_
When building the statement for the statement cache (e.g. for `find` or `find_by`) Active Record is passing `ActiveRecord::StatementCache::Substitute` objects into the attribute type's `cast` method.  The return value for these cast calls isn't very important, but it is relying on it not raising an exception when this happens.  For instance, ActiveModel::Type::Float#cast_value will raise an exception when it tries to call `to_f` on this `ActiveRecord::StatementCache::Substitute` object.  This can also be a problem for custom attribute types._x000D_
_x000D_
The included regression test shows the problem without the corresponding fix in this PR, because `NumericData.find_by(temperature: 1.5)` causes the following exception to be raised_x000D_
_x000D_
```_x000D_

### Solution_x000D_
_x000D_
The Active Model attribute type shouldn't have to deal with these `ActiveRecord::StatementCache::Substitute` objects, so I changed ActiveRecord::Relation::QueryAttribute#value_for_database to not call `super` if it gets one of these objects.  This class was already special casing these objects, since it already had a type check for them in its `nil?` method.","C 0000209",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

_x000D_
That main purpose of this PR is to make the following example _testable_:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
class ChatRelayJob < ApplicationJob_x000D_
  def perform_later(room, msg)_x000D_
    ChatChannel.broadcast_to room, message: msg_x000D_
  end_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
To test this functionality we need to know the underlying stream name_x000D_
(to use `assert_broadcasts`), which relies on `channel_name`._x000D_
_x000D_
We had to use the following code:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
assert_broadcasts(ChatChannel.broadcasting_for([ChatChannel.channel_name, room]), 1) do_x000D_
  ChatRelayJob.perform_now_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
The problem with this approach is that we use _internal_ API: we shouldn't care about `channel_name` prefix in our code (and how should developers know that it's even used?)._x000D_
_x000D_
With this commit we could re-write the test as following:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
 assert_broadcasts(ChatChannel.broadcasting_for(room), 1) do_x000D_
   ChatRelayJob.perform_now_x000D_
 end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
IMO, this refactoring also makes the `broadcasting_for` method much easier to use _internally_, since we should't think about adding a `channel_name` every time we use it (like we did in `channel/streams`)._x000D_
_x000D_
This PR also adds `Channel#broadcast_to` (we had `#steam_for` but hadn't a shorter syntax for broadcasting for some reason)._x000D_
_x000D_
**NOTE:** in [`action-cable-testing`](https://github.com/palkan/action-cable-testing) we handled this differently: by adding `channel: ...` option to assertions; but that was a temporary hack since we couldn't change the Rails API._x000D_

Have you noticed an unexpected behavior in this method for 'minute' and 'second'? It does not work, and does not show an error message about invalid parameters. _x000D_
_x000D_
The only way to use this method is to write  'min' instead of 'minute' and 'sec' instead of 'second':_x000D_

2. Raise an error if user tries to use 'minute' or 'second' as arguments._x000D_

"### Problem_x000D_
_x000D_
Using a where condition on a composed_of attribute with a `nil` value doesn't work as expected._x000D_
_x000D_
If the composed_of attribute has a single mapping, then a condition like `where(gps_location: nil)` will end up with `WHERE 1=0` in the SQL query, so it never matches any row.  This is because the value gets turned into an array using `Array.wrap(value)` where `Array.wrap(nil)` returns `[]`, making the example query effectively `where(gps_location: [])`._x000D_
_x000D_
If the composed_of attribute has multiple mappings, then it results in a `Arel::Visitors::UnsupportedVisitError: Unsupported argument type: NilClass. Construct an Arel node instead.` being raised because of the same mis-use of `Array.wrap`.  It builds separate conditions for an empty array of values , then tries to `OR` an empty array of them (`[].reduce(&:or)`), which results in `nil`, which isn't a valid Arel node._x000D_
_x000D_
### Solution_x000D_
_x000D_
Replace `Array.wrap(value)` with `value.nil? ? [nil] : Array.wrap(value)` and use `try!` to avoid calling the aggregate attribute method on `nil`._x000D_
_x000D_
This issue also shows that empty values were being handled in the multiple mappings path, so I re-used the single values path to handle that by changing the condition to `if mapping.length == 1 || values.empty?`.  If that is too implicit, I could add a separate `if values.empty?` branch that just does `build(table.arel_attribute(column_name), values)`, which would have the same effect.","C 0000237",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It appears that `ActiveStorage` enqueues `ActiveStorage::AnalyzeJob`s when attaching a file. This prompts `ActiveJob` to enqueue jobs (via the async queue adapter by default in development) and can cause problems for one-off scripts such as database seeding._x000D_
_x000D_
This may also be a symptom of a bigger problem with `ActiveStorage`'s queueing assumptions, or maybe the async job adapter. For now, I think temporarily setting the queue adapter to inline for all seeding in all environments is reasonable._x000D_

Before this change, it was not possible to use ActionCable in a web worker because it would throw an error when trying to access `window` or `document`, which are not available in the [`WorkerGlobalScope`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope)._x000D_
_x000D_
It may be desirable to offload WebSocket interaction to a worker to free up the main thread for other activity. But even in applications where the main thread can handle WebSocket interaction and other tasks just fine, there's still a benefit to running ActionCable in a worker: If it is common for your users to have multiple tabs of your application open at once, you can take advantage of the [`SharedWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) API to reduce load on your servers. With a `SharedWorker`, multiple tabs can share a single WebSocket connection, meaning you can drastically reduce the number of active connections (if users commonly have 2 tabs open, this can cut the number of connections in half - if they have more than 2, it's even more significant)._x000D_
_x000D_
Fortunately, it's not too difficult to address the issues that prevent the current version of ActionCable from running in a worker. To support the worker context in addition to the window context, it's recommended to use [`self`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/self) instead of `window` . So that's what the first change in this PR does. To avoid the `document` `ReferenceError`, I've removed the explicit `document` receiver from the `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` calls. The `visibilitychange` event won't ever get triggered in a worker, so adding the listener is effectively a no-op there. But this listener is not critical for ActionCable to function properly; it's more of a ""nice to have"", so ActionCable is still fully functional even without that event handler getting invoked. With those two changes, ActionCable can run in a worker._x000D_

In #34177 we converted the ActionCable JS package from CoffeeScript to ES2015. The conversion was largely automated by [decaffeinate](https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate), and then looked over manually to make it more idiomatic. Looking again after some time away, I found a few more non-idiomatic artifacts from the CoffeeScript conversion that could be simplified, and I've addressed them in this PR:_x000D_
_x000D_
- Simplify `ActionCable.createConsumer` by using default argument_x000D_
_x000D_
- Simplify `ActionCable.getConfig`, `Connection#getProtocol`, and `Connection#close` by relying on the implicit `undefined` return value (instead of explicitly `return`ing `undefined`)_x000D_
_x000D_
- Simplify `this.isActive() && this.webSocket` into `this.isActive()` in `Connection#close`. We can do this because `isActive()` can only return `true` if `this.webSocket` is truthy. (We can't have an active connection without having instantiated a WebSocket. This is confirmed in the code: `Connection#isActive` calls `Connection#isState` which calls `Connection#getState`, which checks if `this.webSocket` is truthy and returns `null` otherwise.)","C 0000260",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

As can be seen from the benchmarks, this patch makes the benchmark on Ruby 2.6 many times faster.  However, it's still slower than Ruby 2.5.  The new enumerator type returned by `each` in Ruby 2.6 seems to do more work than Ruby 2.5.  I'll investigate, but we may just have to live with this speed regression.","C 0000284",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

`ActiveJob` exception tests were being run multiple times, one per adapter, but using always the test adapter. This made a bug that happened only for `resque` to go undetected. This PR tackles both issues._x000D_

### More details_x000D_

[`ExceptionsTest` for `ActiveJob` currently extends `ActiveJob::TestCase`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9cfcc067e626f0f1e220cc00a9f96622a936350d/activejob/test/cases/exceptions_test.rb#L7) instead of `ActiveSupport::TestCase` as the other tests. This has the consequence that the test adapter provided for tests was being used always, in all executions where supposedly different adapters were being used. This pull request rewrites the tests so that they can be run without extending `ActiveJob::TestCase`._x000D_
_x000D_
These tests cover the new individual execution counters for exceptions (#34352). We found an issue with these in our app that uses `resque`: the individual counters are stored as `Hash.new(0)`, which after being serialized, stored in Redis, and deserialized, becomes a regular hash without a default value. The tests were passing because they weren't being executed with `resque` at all. This pull request fixes that small bug as well. ","C 0000290",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

_x000D_
When used with case-insensitive filesystems ActiveStorage blobs might cause non-portable Disk storage directories to be created, and the UNIQUE index that gets configured on the `active_storage_blobs` table is database-dependent in terms of case-sensitivity. If the database index is case-sensitive, but the underlying filesystem is not, blobs might be overwritten and the available key space for uploaded blobs shrinks drastically. This does happen on macOS filesystems already._x000D_
_x000D_
This patch changes the ActiveStorage key generation from mixed-case base-58 to lowercase base-36, and increases the key size from 24 bytes to 28. When using base58 there are `58**24` possible key values, and to have the same or more possible keys with base36 we need to have `36**28`, increasing the storage requirement for the key by 4 bytes. Since the database migrations for the blobs table are not CHAR()-size-restricted (and the fix worked for me both on SQLite and MySQL) I believe this is a reasonable compromise._x000D_
_x000D_
Note that this will not alter the storage keys that have already been generated, their treatment wills tay unchanged. Neither will it correct the storage directory structures that were created using mixed-case keys on macOS since you need to ""rekey"" the stored objects if you want the storage directory to be portable to a case-sensitive filesystem._x000D_
_x000D_
Closes #34804 , addresses the underlying issue in #33864 for freshly-generated uploaded blobs. Unfortunately it cannot be excluded that for some people some blobs already did get overwritten if SQLite was used in combination with a case-insensitive filesystem and the Disk storage service. Neither does this change existing blob keys._x000D_
_x000D_
This change does have an implication that for existing S3 buckets and for other services that potentially use ""naive partitioning"" (first N  bytes of the given object store key) partition usage is going to become less ""fair"". However, AWS recently dropped the recommendation on manual key distribution for the key prefix (https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/10/amazon-s3-performance-increase) as it seems they have adopted hashing for the keys the user provides, so this would not be a problem for buckets that get created._x000D_
_x000D_
The advantages of using a lowercase-only key:_x000D_
_x000D_
* Less potential issues with collation-sensitive database indices_x000D_
* Removes issues with potentially case-insensitive blob stores_x000D_
* Makes it easier to download blobs from a remote store to a case-insensitive filesystem for debugging","C 0000334",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This adds `Date.use_beginning_of_week` for setting `Date.beginning_of_week` locally inside the supplied block. `Date.beginning_of_week` is reset back to the original value when complete. This is very much like `Time.use_zone` - it can be used in a controller `around_action` to easily set the beginning of the week for code executing within a controller action.

While evaluating [multi-environment credentials](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33521#issuecomment-449735483), I came across a problem trying to create a new environment for my app._x000D_
_x000D_
Once you have created your first environment (e.g. `development`) you might start adding configuration in initialisers that tries to access encrypted credentials like so:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
# config/initializers/sidekiq.rb_x000D_
Sidekiq::Web.set :session_secret, Rails.application.credentials.secret_key_base!_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
That works fine when running `rails credentials:edit --environment development` _x000D_
_x000D_
If you now decide to create a `staging` environment,  doing `rails credentials:edit --environment staging` will fail with something similar to `...ordered_options.rb:49:in 'method_missing': :secret_key_base is blank (KeyError)`_x000D_
_x000D_
A great many gems that access 3rd party APIs use an initialiser for configuring credentials so the above situation is quite likely to occur._x000D_
_x000D_
I worked around the issue by creating a new empty Rails app, running `rails credentials:edit --environment staging` in it, and copying across the generated credential files. _x000D_
_x000D_
This PR attempts to fix the issue by not loading the application environment for `rails credentials:*` commands._x000D_

In an application that has a primary and replica database the data_x000D_
inserted on the primary connection will not be able to be read by the_x000D_
replica connection._x000D_
_x000D_
In a test like this:_x000D_
_x000D_
```_x000D_
test ""creating a home and then reading it"" do_x000D_
  home = Home.create!(owner: ""eileencodes"")_x000D_
_x000D_
  ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :default) do_x000D_
    assert_equal 3, Home.count_x000D_
  end_x000D_

    assert_equal 3, Home.count_x000D_
  end_x000D_
end_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
The home inserted in the beginning of the test can't be read by the_x000D_
replica database because when the test is started a transasction is_x000D_
opened byy `setup_fixtures`. That transaction remains open for the_x000D_
remainder of the test until we are done and run `teardown_fixtures`._x000D_
_x000D_
Because the data isn't actually committed to the database the replica_x000D_
database cannot see the data insertion._x000D_
_x000D_
I considered a couple ways to fix this. I could have written a database_x000D_
cleaner like class that would allow the data to be committed and then_x000D_
clean up that data afterwards. But database cleaners can make the_x000D_
database slow and the point of the fixtures is to be fast._x000D_
_x000D_
In GitHub we solve this by sharing the connection pool for the replicas_x000D_
with the primary (writing) connection. This is a bit hacky but it works._x000D_
Additionally since we define `replica? || preventing_writes?` as the_x000D_
code that blocks writes to the database this will still prevent writing_x000D_
on the replica / readonly connection. So we get all the behavior of_x000D_
multiple connections for the same database without slowing down the_x000D_
database._x000D_
_x000D_
In this PR the code loops through the handlers. If the handler doesn't_x000D_
match the default handler then it retrieves the connection pool from the_x000D_
default / writing handler and assigns the reading handler's connections_x000D_
to that pool._x000D_
_x000D_
Then in enlist_fixture_connections it maps all the connections for the_x000D_
default handler because all the connections are now available on that_x000D_
handler so we don't need to loop through them again._x000D_
_x000D_
The test uses a temporary connection pool so we can test this with_x000D_
sqlite3_mem. This adapter doesn't behave the same as the others and_x000D_
after looking over how the query cache test works I think this is the_x000D_
most correct. The issues comes when calling `connects_to` because that_x000D_

"### Summary_x000D_
_x000D_
When generating a new rails application (`rails new`) using a custom template that _x000D_
includes gems from an authenticated source, the user has to provide credentials to _x000D_
`bundler`._x000D_
_x000D_
One way to do this is by [exporting environment variables](https://bundler.io/v1.16/bundle_config.html#CREDENTIALS-FOR-GEM-SOURCES), for example:_x000D_
_x000D_
`export BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=user:pass`: provides credentials for bundler to fetch_x000D_
gems from `github.com`._x000D_
_x000D_
The problem this PR addresses is that we are currently scrubs all `/BUNDLE_.*/`_x000D_
environment variables by wrapping our system calls in [`Bundler.with_clean_env`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5b5319413a611c949cb796351ff42fa0c0299252/railties/lib/rails/generators/app_base.rb#L381-L388)._x000D_
_x000D_
We do this because we don't want our commands executed against the generated project_x000D_
to use the generator's `bundler` environment (e.g. our gems): the generated project should_x000D_
use it's own configuration._x000D_
_x000D_
The problem with `Bundler.with_clean_env` is that, on top of restoring environment_x000D_
variables to their original state, it also scrubs any `/BUNDLE_.*/` variables, which is harmful for authenticated gem sources._x000D_
_x000D_
This PR replaces `Bundler.with_clean_env` with `Bundler.with_original_env`, which only_x000D_
restores environment variables to their initial state, without additional scrubbing._x000D_

"### Context_x000D_
_x000D_
When trying to create a separate _cable_ instance (e.g. within an engine), we faced a problem of `ActionCable::Server::Base` relying on the _global_ configuration (i.e. `ActionCable::Server::Base.config`). _x000D_
_x000D_
We want our engine to have a separate, isolated, Cable server instance with its own configuration._x000D_
_x000D_
See the example app using this patch: https://github.com/palkan/engine-cable-app_x000D_
_x000D_
### Summary_x000D_
_x000D_
- Add ability to pass a config as a `Server.new` argument._x000D_
_x000D_
### Other Information_x000D_
_x000D_
This problem has been already discussed here: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27425#discussion_r96065280 (we've adjusted the test from that PR as well)._x000D_
_x000D_
The related issue not included into this patch (separate PR?): currently, only the Redis adapter supports channels prefixes.  With the ability to have _engined_ cables we'll need to isolate streams for all _distributed_ adapters (e.g. `postgresql`, `async`/`inline` adapters do not share anything)._x000D_
_x000D_
One potential caveat of using multiples cables within the app is the lack of isolation for channel classes, i.e. it is possible to subscribe (or at least try to) to any channel from any connection (see https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.2.2/actioncable/lib/action_cable/connection/subscriptions.rb#L35)._x000D_
_x000D_
One possible solution is to add `config.base_channel_class` parameter and use it instead of a `ActionCable::Channel::Base` (i.e. `config.base_channel_class >= subscription_klass`)._x000D_
_x000D_
Another way is to get away from using Ruby class names as identifiers, and build a per-connection registry/map of identifiers->class (like it's done in https://github.com/palkan/litecable)._x000D_

This PR aims to fix a corner case concerning UJS behavior._x000D_

The second invocation again takes the inner text (now the data-diable-with) and overwrites the saved text making the link always show the data-disabled-with text, even after reenabling, since the original text, saved within an attribute was overwritten during the second invocation._x000D_

_x000D_
While you could make sure none of the handlers target the same elements, disabling a disabled element should not cause issues at any time.

In https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34367, we merged a breaking change to `actionmailer` that changed the parameters of `DeliveryJob`. This will cause upgrade pains for any app delivering mail in the background. This patch attempts to rectify the situation by reverting and deprecating `DeliveryJob` and `Parameterized::DeliveryJob` and introducing `NewDeliveryJob` to send either kind of mail._x000D_
_x000D_
Because web and job workers aren't always deployed to in lockstep, and enqueued jobs can be worked off at any time during a deployment, we have two problems to solve:_x000D_
_x000D_
1. Old delivery jobs need to be able to be worked off by a rails 6 job worker._x000D_
2. New delivery jobs have to be able to be worked off by an old rails 5.x job worker._x000D_
_x000D_
So, the parameter change to `DeliveryJob` needs to be reverted and `Parameterized::DeliveryJob` needs to be brought back to satisfy problem 1. And, the `NewDeliveryJob` class needs to be backported to 5.x to satisfy problem 2. I'll followup with a backport PR if we can all agree on this course of action._x000D_

> This seems undesirable. If you have a stale `yarn.lock` in the root, it won't be modified to add new packages when you `git pull`, even if new dependencies have been added in one of the workspaces. This means that when you run `yarn install`, you won't have all the dependencies installed. You have to first run `rm yarn.lock` to remove your stale lockfile, and then run `yarn install` to get everything installed. Since the root `yarn.lock` is currently in the `.gitignore`, it's easy to miss that you have this file locally, so it's not obvious that you should run `rm yarn.lock` before `yarn install`._x000D_

Pass the `connection` to the `@instrumenter.instrument` call in the `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters#log` method._x000D_
_x000D_
## Why we need that ?_x000D_
_x000D_
Because you already pass the `object_id` (`:connection_id  => object_id`) of the `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters` instance which will then force us to use `ObjectSpace._id2ref` function to retrieve this instance but:_x000D_
 1. `ObjectSpace._id2ref` is not accessible in JRuby_x000D_
 2. @headius said this: ""_id2ref should never be use by any code anywhere. It isn't even safe on MRI."". Here: https://twitter.com/headius/status/1068188351012966402_x000D_
_x000D_
So when you pass `:connection_id  => object_id`, it's not that useful. 😕_x000D_
Passing directly the reference of the object is better for users._x000D_

This updates the guides to include examples of useful patterns for organizing _test helpers_, and preventing `test_helpers.rb` from getting bloated. It adds two sections:_x000D_
_x000D_
- **Extracting Files**, which discusses extracting modules and where they could be put_x000D_
- **Eagerly Requiring Helpers**, which discusses how to easily require these modules for convenience_x000D_
_x000D_
### Motivation_x000D_
_x000D_
I was unable to find good documentation on how to organize test helpers or custom assertions. Unfortunately, the existing documentation's pattern of adding directly to `test_helper.rb` can lead to that file becoming bloated. The closest related information I could find was [RSpec's documentation on the use of `spec/support`](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/blob/8c3a238f8cb26b5821dc4ccaacff2f2088bf2adc/lib/generators/rspec/install/templates/spec/rails_helper.rb#L10-L23)._x000D_
_x000D_
### Why not `test/support`?_x000D_
_x000D_
In my discussion with @rafaelfranca, I had originally leaned towards `test/support`. However, in the event that the helpers are complex enough to warrant tests, it is not obvious how this should be handled:_x000D_
_x000D_
- Should the tests be in `test/support`, and explicitly ignored when eagerly requiring the contents of that directory?_x000D_
- Should the tests be in another folder, such as `test/unit`?_x000D_
_x000D_
@rafaelfranca's suggestion of promoting the helpers to the `lib/test` directory has an obvious test location of `test/lib`, making it a good fit for a recommended pattern._x000D_

"This adds a new method `or` to WhereChain. This can be used to more easily write WHERE clauses that use the OR operator, using familiar hash/array/string arguments that `where` takes. But unlike the existing ActiveRecord::Relation `or`, this will not require repeating the scope._x000D_
_x000D_
For example, where you previously would have had to go with one of these options:_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
Post.where(title: 'Goodbye').or(Post.where(active: true))_x000D_
Post.where(""title = 'Goodbye' OR active = true"")_x000D_
```_x000D_
Now you can define the two (or more) operands using the same types of arguments passed to `where`:_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
Post.where.or(""active = true"", [""created_at > ?"", Date.today], { title: 'Goodbye' })_x000D_
```_x000D_
This is good for simple ""OR"" scenarios, where repeating the starting scope would make things messier. If the conditions that need to be combined with ""OR"" are more complex, then defining two scopes and combining them using the existing `or` method is probably the better option._x000D_
_x000D_
Making this a method on WhereChain ought to alleviate the concerns in #9052 about how a more flexible `or` method would affect what comes before or after it in a method chain. In this implementation, the ""OR"" operator only gets applied to the conditions included in its own arguments._x000D_
_x000D_
This new method is currently written to use the existing ActiveRecord `or` method under the hood, but I'm open to alternatives._x000D_

"First of all, let me explain my use case: I have a heavy JSONB DB column which I want to exclude from most of the queries, that's why I've decided to use [ignored_columns](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ModelSchema/ClassMethods.html#method-i-ignored_column) feature. This column is populated via DB trigger, and sometimes I do want to have it loaded, in such cases I explicitly load it (for instance, using `.select(""*"")`). Also, I have a custom `ActiveRecord::Type` to make interactions with the underlying JSON easier. The problem is that with this combination the value I get when I call that accessor is a _value from the DB_, custom type is completely ignored._x000D_
_x000D_
Here is a simplier example with a string instead of JSON:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
class DeveloperName < ActiveRecord::Type::String_x000D_
  def deserialize(value)_x000D_
    ""Developer: #{value}""_x000D_
  end_x000D_
end_x000D_
_x000D_
class AttributedDeveloper < ActiveRecord::Base_x000D_
  self.table_name = ""developers""_x000D_
_x000D_
  attribute :name, DeveloperName.new_x000D_
_x000D_
  self.ignored_columns += [""name""]_x000D_
end_x000D_
_x000D_
developer = AttributedDeveloper.create_x000D_
developer.update_column :name, ""name""_x000D_
_x000D_
loaded_developer = AttributedDeveloper.where(id: developer.id).select(""*"").first_x000D_
puts loaded_developer.name # should be ""Developer: name"" but it's just ""name""_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
Here is a reason why it happens:_x000D_
1. `ignored_columns` removes the column from the column_hash_x000D_
2. `#select_all` can fill `column_types` for the result set when DB provides the types (only PostgreSQL does it, so other tests for other DBs cannot reproduce the problem)_x000D_
3. when `#find_by_sql` prepares the `ActiveRecord::Result`, it uses `column_hash` to remove all the types coming from the DB because we know how to handle them_x000D_
4. Ignored columns are not in the `column_hash` so `#find_by_sql` defines the accessor method with the DB-provided type and custom `attribute` is ignored_x000D_
_x000D_
My solution is to remove `attributes_to_define_after_schema_loads` keys from the `column_types` along with `column_hash` keys because having the custom attributes means that we do know how to deserialize this field.","C 0000479",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

The referenced issue maps the first `root` to `/form/:foo`, and a second one to `/`.

The second root is not used, and can't be referenced by a named route helper because it doesn't have a name._x000D_

@kaspth you can't really have a global default inflector setter, it is fundamental that each instance has total control over its inflector. When you ship a gem, you cannot get the inflector changed, your code depends on the inflector you configure. Logging is a bit different, because the only purpose is to debug problems, gems are expected to ship with the default `nil` logger._x000D_

So in order to fix the issue and keep the functionality instead of changing the `column_name`, `distinct` is assigned with the `select_for_count` values. _x000D_

I think this fixes the issue with the minor impact. _x000D_

_x000D_
TL;DR: Quoting schema/tables is the same in SQLite as the other databases. No weird need for ""."", the fix is correct and just made my code start actually testing the right thing and find a subtle bug elsewhere. SQLite's Attached database was never actually supported, and supporting them appears not worth the trouble._x000D_
_x000D_
Because of the bad quoting that was going on before the fix, when my gem, in its tests, would create a table in a database (using `create_table ""my_schema.thing"" do ...`), the actual generated SQL would be a `CREATE TABLE ""my_schema.thing""`). This is actually a table with a name that contain a dot, and not a table that refers to the schema._x000D_
_x000D_
Then, later on, the code in all my tests also also used the quote_table_name, and so everything always used a table_name with a dot instead of testing actual schemas._x000D_
_x000D_
What threw me in this weird quoting behavior understanding in 6.0 is that I would get syntax errors when trying to use the models. But that was not form the select or such things. No. It was from a call to PRAGMA which does things special for schemas (attached database). See, this is the query to get the table information in SQLite:_x000D_
_x000D_
`""PRAGMA table_info(#{quote_table_name(table_name)})""`_x000D_
_x000D_
However, when dealing with database, the actual syntax is_x000D_
_x000D_
`""PRAGMA schema_name.table_info(table_name)""`_x000D_
_x000D_
But those kinds of calls are not shown in the log, so I would get confused thinking the problem was in the previous query (because the problematic query is not shown in the error messages... which i don't know why)._x000D_
_x000D_
Now that part could be fixed with some code to split the table name into schema + table in an intelligent way (so that quoted parts remain the same). But here is a the kicker:_x000D_
_x000D_
In a `SELECT` in SQLite, you cannot specify the database at the attributes parts. Meaning:_x000D_
_x000D_
`SELECT bar.id FROM foo.bar` is valid, but_x000D_
`SELECT foo.bar.id FROM foo.bar` is not valid, its a syntax error!_x000D_
_x000D_
So in order to generate correct queries here, things get even more wild. It's clear to me that this is not worth my trouble (or anyone's)._x000D_

As @yhara described at https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/35296#issuecomment-464319765, the default proc in the `@owner_to_pool` has a reference to the handler as the implcit `self`, so the finalizer proc which has a reference to the `@owner_to_pool` is not right usage to pass `ObjectSpace.define_finalizer`._x000D_

"## Patch motivation_x000D_
_x000D_
 Here is the test that fails: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/35247/files#diff-f51660d918ba5921aaae392122026533R2088_x000D_
_x000D_
It fails because source association is loaded with the a target through association scope aka `reflection.scope`: the one that is at the association definition: _x000D_
_x000D_
``` ruby_x000D_
test/models/author.rb:44:  has_many :comments_desc, -> { order(""comments.id DESC"") }, through: :posts_sorted_by_id, source: :comments_x000D_
```_x000D_
_x000D_
But this scope is alien to the `source_reflection`._x000D_
So the reset should happen based on the scope passed to the source reflection preloader: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/35247/files#diff-ca84a6da4dec54d0ca3e430fbb352ad9R12_x000D_
_x000D_
It makes the reset consistent with the custom scope (3rd argument) passed to the preloader: when passed non-empty scope always reset._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
## Reset problem_x000D_
_x000D_
Current implementation of the preloading is odd: at first we load the records into the association (aka assigning the `Association#target`) with an alien scope and then we take the records from there into memory and reseting the association. There should be test cases where the already loaded association would be reset if we put the `preload` argument to the right order. Like:_x000D_
_x000D_
```_x000D_
Author.has_many :posts, -> { custom_scope1 }_x000D_
Author.has_many :comments, through: :posts, -> { custom_scope2 } _x000D_
Author.preload(:posts => {:comments},  :comments => {} ).first_x000D_
```_x000D_

In this example, we preload the `comments` association before the through association that would use that association as a source._x000D_
_x000D_
Only in this specific order, it will cause the `Post#comments`  to be reset after being preloaded._x000D_
_x000D_
A more complex scenario to reveal this bug should exist before this patch. The reset was happening only when `preload_scope` was given which can only present for through association of the 2nd tier (aka has many through through).  _x000D_
_x000D_
## Solution_x000D_
_x000D_
The only way to fix that in all cases is never set the `Association#target` inside preloader when `preload_scope` is given._x000D_
_x000D_
I am working on this patch now and I am optimistic it is doable in an adequate way. However, this is not a trivial patch (~100 lines changed in the diff)._x000D_

_x000D_
In classic mode, if you define `Foo = Bar = 1` in `app/models/foo.rb`, dependencies has `Bar` in `autoloaded_constants`. I believe that is a side-effect of the implementation, more than a deliberate feature._x000D_
_x000D_
In the new mode we enforce one file = one constant path, except for inner classes. There is a technical reason for it, which is that we keep track of what is loaded in the decoration of `Kernel#require`. Given an absolute file name, we know the parent module and constant name that corresponds to, there is no way to detect `Bar`._x000D_

In Zeitwerk, pushing a non-existing directory is an error. As always, microdecisions. In this case the idea is to prevent misconfiguring directories with typos in their names or whatever and fail fast. On the other hand, the point of view in which you do not consider that to be an error, and just ignore the non-existing ones on setup, is also valid._x000D_
_x000D_
The decision depends on use cases. You can have empty directories, but not non-existing directories. Do we have real use cases that deserve changing this logic? Similarly, with classic autoloading, the subdirectories under `app` _at boot_ are the ones in autoload paths, if you add a new one (`app/services`), you need to restart the server._x000D_

_x000D_
Hey @eregon! It was in my TODO to contact the JRuby/TruffleRuby teams about it._x000D_
_x000D_
Right now, Zeitwerk only supports CRuby. One of the reasons is that it needs `Kernel#autoload` to call `Kernel#require`, because it is key to be able to [decorate it](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk/blob/master/lib/zeitwerk/kernel.rb). I am watching https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/5403 regarding this._x000D_
_x000D_
Another detail, is that in order to support what I call [explicit namespaces](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk#explicit-namespaces) the library sets a trace point on the `:class` event. Last time I checked, JRuby does not emit this particular event unless you pass the `--debug` flag. I am not familiar with that flag, but does not seem like something you'd enable in production normally._x000D_
_x000D_
On the other hand the `:class` event is triggered rarely in regular code bases, so I wanted to ask if the JRuby team would consider broadcasting that one in the default mode._x000D_
_x000D_
Furthermore, the test suite has a [Ruby compatibility suite](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk/blob/master/test/lib/zeitwerk/test_ruby_compatibility.rb) in case it helps. I don't know right now if it is exhaustive, should do a pass and document in which way we depend on each property, but it is a good indicator._x000D_
_x000D_
Please anything else just let me know, would be awesome that the library is portable._x000D_

I strongly feel that's a bug worth fixing, not doubling down on... and I think it's hugely more common to create a new namespaced model (that is, a new namespace) than it is to invent a new `app/*/` type, so I think this will be quickly problematic if I'm correctly understanding the new behaviour._x000D_
_x000D_
To be clear, I agree with the design decision at Zeitwerk's level that a missing directory should be an error: I just think that Rails in its soft-friendly-autoloady configuration will want to be more forgiving, and I think that means a fully dynamic app (drawing a distinction between ""basic"" autoload and ""genuinely expect files to change/appear/disappear"" reload+autoload) ultimately can't freeze the path list._x000D_

Ah, let's make sure we are in sync on this one! New namespaces are picked up just fine. If you create `app/models/admin` and reload, `Admin` is autoloadable right away.

If those hashes don't have string keys, we would get a deprecation notice. I guess what's protecting the code from doing that is the fact that you are calling `.to_sym` before passing `key` to `super`, so that writes always get a symbol key._x000D_

It is part of the cache key, just in a round-about way (unfortunately).

_x000D_
Yes, the resolver is part of the public API. José's idea was to make possible to people to write custom resolvers to, for example, read a template from the database (he shows an example of that in his book) We at Shopify have a custom resolver to build a list of all view paths that are possible at boot time. Why do you think it should be private?","C 0000950",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"> Why do you think it should be private?_x000D_
_x000D_
Some of the method parameters require knowledge of internals that I don't think people should have.  The main example of this is the `key` parameter and the `details` hash [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2799a502ad361451ba26bcab8f9039268160bdf6/actionview/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb#L145).  Key and details have to do with caching.  If someone wants to write a caching resolver, they should wrap a non-caching resolver with their own caching strategy.  I guess the main issue for me is that these parameters are leaking implementation details about the class.  Since the API is public, I think it couples us to the current caching strategy._x000D_
_x000D_
TBH, I think we can maintain the API, I just want to have a gauge for how quickly it can change.  I would like to change it more quickly, so making it private would help.  But if there are real apps (like Shopify) using it, then I'll be more careful about maintaining the API.","C 0000951",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To be fair, I think we can change this more quickly than other public APIs we have.

"I would like to give you @Samemura a good advice that might help hit upon a good word or an implementation for for your intention. To begin with, I must explain some grammars. In general, prepositions take objects to the right as their complements, and Adverbs to the left (like one day **ago** and **in** one day), so when we want to write code in a similar way, we have to choose a preposition for a method name (unless you want to define a DSL that enables us to place methods after an object like `1.day.earlier.`) Besides, the word `before` can be a preposition, adverb, and conjunction. To name a few, when a noun phrase follows `before`, it means time prior to some event or an object in front of something, and in both cases, before is a preposition. To indicate time prior to a specific event, We can use the conjunction `before` as well. for example, `before dinner` and `before we have dinner` mean the same. In your code example, `before` acts as a preposition, so the meaning is `time prior prior to a day`, and is ambiguous because we don't have any idea about what and when the day is, and can interpret it as a yesterday or some time before some day, except for the case we use something like `today` instead of `1.day`. So It could be that this wouldn't improve code naturalness. Chaining methods, on the other hand, can serve your purpose,  allowing us to write `1.day.before` and `1.day.ago`, which are in the completely, grammatically correct order. Have you ever given it a try? or Any other good preposition?","C 0001049",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah. Initially I started making those two functions configurable like:_x000D_
```diff_x000D_

+const defaultOptions = { getConfig, createWebSocketURL }_x000D_
+_x000D_

+  return new Consumer((options.createWebSocketURL || defaultOptions.createWebSocketURL)(url))_x000D_
 }_x000D_
```_x000D_
so that if you were using it in a web worker you could pass your own `getConfig` and `createWebSocketURL` that didn't rely on `document`.

This works in isolation, but I would strongly recommend against it in a real application. Modifying global state like that to fake that the worker script is running in a window context will leak into all the other code in the worker. This is dangerous because it can break other library code used by the worker by tricking it into incorrectly [assuming the worker is running in a window environment](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/75c8b3f146aaa8a71f7dca0263686fb1799f8f31/lib/utils.js#L168-L193) and using that assumption to access interfaces that aren't actually available._x000D_

_x000D_
I don't want to impose any long term maintenance commitment, so let's try to avoid that. How about we maintain that Rails doesn't officially support running ActionCable in a worker and that it could break at any time, while still avoiding the current `ReferenceError`s with these changes. (It's actually been great how stable the ActionCable's javascript package has been since the release, so I wouldn't be surprised if it still worked in a year, but we can avoid making any support guarantees.)_x000D_

_x000D_
`if (self instanceof Window) { … }` is a lot nicer to read/more self-documenting, but unfortunately would also throw a `ReferenceError` since the `Window` constructor is similarly not defined in the worker global scope. But, I just pushed up a simpler alternative which is to call `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` without the explicit receiver. That'll still work in the window context while effectively being a no-op in the worker context because the `visibilitychange` event won't ever get triggered there. Thus, we don't need to worry about abstracting the `if (typeof document !== ""undefined"")` checks because they've been removed.","C 0001284",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

"How did you measure the new stack? `for` is just a quirky spelling of `each`, so you should still see two more entries (for `each` and the block) than you describe. _x000D_
_x000D_
While I don't love this implementation, I can see alternative versions that could be acceptable... but `inject` is the natural tool for this problem, so I think I'd like to understand a bit more about your use case before we sacrifice readability for it. At a glance, my stack can handle a good 1000+ of the above recursions -- is your query _that_ complex? If so, does it need to be? is AR constructing it poorly? ","PR 000017",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The original stack was from an actual stack trace for a `SystemStackError` we ran into. The new stack was my assumption, which is probably wrong from what you're saying. In that case, it would only remove 3 stack frames, not 5 (the implicit `#each` and block frames would still be there)._x000D_
_x000D_
The case that triggered this for us looked like this:_x000D_
_x000D_
```ruby_x000D_
relation = compound_ids.map do |id1, id2|_x000D_
  Model.where(id1: id1, id2: id2)_x000D_

```_x000D_
_x000D_
When I looked into the stack that triggered the `SystemStackError`, as well as the output of `relation.to_dot` for smaller `compound_ids` lists, I noticed a couple of stack-related inefficiencies._x000D_
_x000D_
First was the large number of stack frames from `inject_join`, which I'm attempting to address here._x000D_
_x000D_
The next was the fact that `WhereClause` always adds an `Arel::Nodes::And` node, even if there is only a single predicate in the `WHERE` clause (cf. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/where_clause.rb#L64-L66). There were also some `Arel::Nodes::Grouping` nodes that seemed to be getting added because Arel isn't aware of SQL operator precedence and adds them just in case. Neither of those are addressed here, but I think they were also a contributing factor on the size of the queries we're able to construct._x000D_
_x000D_
As for the implementation, I think the `i` counter variable can be avoided if it's possible to treat the `list` parameter destructively. In that case, the method can do `return collector if list.empty?` first, then do `collector = visit(list.shift, collector)` before iterating the rest of the list. This would change the loop logic from appending the `join_str` on all but the last element to prepending the `join_str` to every element in `list`, post `#shift`.","PR 000018",0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,2,0,0,0

When I type ""rails 6"" in Google, the link https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/6_0_release_notes.html is second in a list. The article is linked from many other Rails 6 articles. The point is that this is not an obscure text somewhere on The Dark Web - it is a text that many people read in order to see details about Rails 6. I was one of those people. And I was totally confused by the information presented. Imagine the typical confusions of a normal person (who is not active in Rails development/community):_x000D_
- ""Why so little info? Oh, apparently Rails 6 is not released yet... So why can't this article clearly say on the very top of the page that Rails 6 and this documentation are a work-in-progress? It's irritating having to Google separately for this info!""_x000D_
- ""Ok, the Rails 6 is a work in progress, the list of features is not yet complete - I understand all that. But why can't this article have at least something - even some simple mentions on what is upcoming, on what features were already decided to be included?""_x000D_
- ""Rails 6 is work in progress. But why isn't here any info about the timeline in the main document that describes this milestone? Until the release, info about the dates are the most important info one needs (the need for features/compatibility documentation comes after the need for a timeline; everything else becomes important even later on). Do I really have to be an active part of the Rails development community in order to get a simple answer? Do I really need to start reading blogs just to see some glimpses and guestimations about the possible release dates? Looks totally excessive... I wish this important info was right here and there would be a volunteer, who would bother to make such changes...""_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Rails 6 will be one of the biggest releases yet. Cool changes to Rails should be actively promoted (it's not like Rails has been winning the Web competition even against Python). The documentation page is an essential part of Rails's marketing. It should be used to the fullest, even if the info written is there only temporarily and will be deleted after the release. The fact that this info will be there for a year, informing the very people interested in the release, is more than enough to make an effort to make proposed changes worth it._x000D_
_x000D_
If you still disagree, then [this page](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/6_0_release_notes.html) should be closed from public view. I would prefer not to, but for the sake of consistency this must be done. The link should start working publicly only after the release since the article should tell only about stuff that has already happened. If I will make this suggestion can I count on your approval/support?_x000D_
_x000D_

> Let's wait for Action Text and Action Mailbox to be merged into Rails before we write about them. _x000D_
The decision to include both was already made:_x000D_
- https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/10/3/introducing-action-text-for-rails-6/_x000D_
- https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/12/13/introducing-action-mailbox-for-rails-6/_x000D_
Both posts were written by the DHH himself, on Rails's official web site. This is as close to the actual merge as one gets._x000D_
_x000D_
The Release Notes page for Rails 6 are 'Work in progress'. So why isn't work on it allowed?_x000D_
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2521942/50098587-e8d71a00-0224-11e9-9d46-2e2b85fbdb65.png)_x000D_
_x000D_
So why to wait? Why to leave things until the last moment? Why to leave it until the crunch time? I am sure that during the release window there will be plenty of other important things to do (admittedly much more technically difficult than what I am doing here; so why not let competent people do the difficult stuff, while I am helping with this kind of important ""minutiae""). Why can't I help a little bit, now that I have time and motivation, to help other people (here and now) that are searching for the relevant information?_x000D_
_x000D_
Marketing = selling ideas to people. This usually means having to go where the people/customers are. Rails is in a very fortunate situation that it has people who come to the aforementioned page in order to be ""sold"" (the idea that Rails 6 will be an awesome release, that Rails is in good hands and is a viable option for development). This opportunity is not used. I had a modest proposal of at least closing the most glaring hole and getting at least some kind of benefit from all the current visitors (who at this moment and until the release will simply waste their time visiting the page and learn absolutely nothing about the main topic of the article)._x000D_

I guess [this link](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/12/20/timeline-for-the-release-of-Rails-6-0/) is what you meant? Thank you for having a separate post about the timeline of Rails! Now my only request would be to put this link at the top of the documentation page. :-)_x000D_
_x000D_
Almost 3 weeks have passed, but this timeline link is not on the first page of Google search results (""rails 6""). I am sure that it could be somewhat easily found by changing the search query, but that doesn't really change my overall points:_x000D_
1. This would require more work from the user. If something can be done to improve ""usability"" (generally speaking), it should be done._x000D_
2. (all the stuff I already wrote about the importance of marketing and use of opportunities like when ""the customer"" is already here to consume relevant information)_x000D_
3. Internet is a linked system. Without links the main purpose of Internet/pages is defeated. One should link important pages with each other. This not only improves the ""usability"" of the web page (those who are interested, can go and read more), but also improves the standing in search engines (a link from the major Rails 6 page would make not only the specific Rails 6 Timeline post more visible and relevant, but would improve the overall standing of the whole Rails blog)._x000D_

"@guizmaii @rafaelfranca Just an FYI, I'm not sure whether this is supposed to be a breaking change for Rails 6, but 3rd party libraries that serialize `ActiveSupport::Notification` events do actually have issues serializing the `sql.active_record` event because the `:connection` value (a complex Adapter object) doesn't serialize well, particularly with JSON._x000D_

_x000D_
I can provide some context as to why I added the tmp directories into the workspaces._x000D_
_x000D_
At the time - we were getting errors in the railties tests that generated applications and then needed to compile the assets as the versions that the were being required (which were based on the `Rails::VERSION` hadn't been published._x000D_
_x000D_
I added in the yarn workspaces in order to allow the Rails application that were generated in the tmp directory visibility of the different required packages. Without the tmp directories in workspace the generated rails applications didn't have visibility of the unpublished packages._x000D_
_x000D_
Since then, the version of the packages that is required was relaxed (https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33079/commits/fbd45978effd8d83a29f95493c59e3e715ceca76) to  include published versions. This was done after a discussion about the differences in the versioning schemes between npm and ruby gems where `Rails::VERSION::STRING` could not be directly used._x000D_
_x000D_
I am not sure what version of the packages was being used in the tests prior to this being merged (ie latest on npm or alpha version that is in the rails repo) but I think that without the tmp directories in the workspace, it will be the 5.2.X versions. I don't know if this is an issue as long as any issues get picked up in the prerelease. All the railties tests are doing are ensuring that the packages can compile, so I think this is unlikely to be an issue unless something is seriously broken._x000D_
_x000D_
I don't think that the workspaces are currently providing any value, but expect that that might change once ActionText is merged, as it depends on the ActiveStorage package._x000D_

I hope that that clears some things up._x000D_

I don't think it's practical to detect read-only queries via string matching, though: even something that explicitly starts with ""SELECT"" can end up writing. I wonder about using `SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY` to have the DB enforce it instead? (Also worth noting I believe most write-ish queries go via `execute`, not `exec_query`.)_x000D_
