{"content": "   Introduction x000D \n x000D \nThis patch integrates  Zeitwerk  https   github com fxn zeitwerk  and makes it the default autoloader for Rails 6 applications  x000D \n x000D \n  You can now robustly use constant paths in class and module definitions  x000D \n x000D \n     ruby x000D \n    Matches Ruby semantics now  x000D \n  class Admin  UsersController   ApplicationController x000D \n          x000D \n  end x000D \n      x000D \n x000D \n  All known use cases of  require dependency  have been eliminated  x000D \n x000D \n  There is a  centralized solution  https   github com fxn zeitwerk preloading  to orderly preload STI hierarchies  x000D \n x000D \n  Edge cases in which the autoloaded constant depended on execution order are gone  x000D \n x000D \n  Autoloading is thread safe in general  not just for the currently supported use cases with explicit locks like web requests  For example  you can now write multi threaded scripts to be run by  bin rails runner  and they will autoload just fine  x000D \n x000D \n   Principles behind the integration x000D \n x000D \nThe classic autoloader has been there since  the beginning  https   github com rails rails blob v1 0 0 activesupport lib active support dependencies rb   and while it has  no public interface  https   api rubyonrails org classes ActiveSupport Dependencies html  except for locking mechanisms  extra care has been taken  x000D \n x000D \n  The implementation of  ActiveSupport  Dependencies  and its test suite are untouched  x000D \n x000D \n  Easy way to opt out  just throw  config autoloader    classic  into  config application rb   It has to go after  config load defaults 6 0  if you have that line  x000D \n x000D \n  Integration has been clearly delineated so that falling back to the classic autoloader is safe  x000D \n x000D \n  It is a key observation that  Kernel autoload  is invoked by the constant resolution algorithm as classes and modules are checked  In particular  it takes precedence over  const missing  and thus we can leave  const missing  there to have a cleaner patch  it won t do anything anyway for autoloadable constants  x000D \n x000D \n  Seamless take over in new apps from an end user point of view  x000D \n x000D \nI envision a gradual evolution of this feature  Rails 6 is just a first step  x000D \n x000D \n   Patch overview x000D \n x000D \n  There is a new config attribute  config autoloader  that can be   classic  or   zeitwerk   This is   zeitwerk  for new apps on CRuby  and   classic  for apps loading the defaults of previous versions or run by other interpreters  x000D \n x000D \n  If Zeitwerk is enabled  there are two globally accessible autoloaders   Rails autoloader   and  Rails once autoloader   The former is the main one  The latter  in addition to not win a Pulitzer for naming  is responsible for  autoload once paths   and importantly also for autoload paths that come from gems  Both autoloaders autoload  but only  Rails autoloader  is invoked by Rails to reload  so if you have engines like Action Storage or Devise installed as gems  they won t be reloaded anymore  x000D \n x000D \n  In particular  if you throw  Rails autoloader logger   method  puts   to  config application rb  you ll see Zeitwerk doing its thing  x000D \n x000D \n  Selected private API is emulated  but it is  not  the goal of the integration to fully replicate the private API  If there is code that depends on the inner workings excessively  I prefer that people switch to   classic  until it gets updated  to clutter the integration to support any imaginable abuse of the private API  This autoloading is an inflection point and it is our opportunity to start afresh  x000D \n x000D \n  Furthermore  the private API called downwards from  const missing  should not be called anymore because  as explained above   Kernel autoload  runs first  There might be some edge case around autoloading errors  not worth it  keep it simple  x000D \n x000D \n  People should not write  require dependency  anymore  and upgrades should delete the calls  If you detect a use case for it please tell us  x000D \n x000D \n  Eager loading calls  Zeitwerk eager load all   Therefore  it will eager load not only the Rails application  but also all gems managed by Zeitwerk  x000D \n x000D \n  Engines can technically use Zeitwerk by clearing their autoload paths  but better don t and leave the choice to the parent application  x000D \n x000D \n  Autoload paths are frozen in the finisher  The public API for them is  config autoload paths   but if existing code is pushing to  ActiveSupport  Dependencies autoload paths   it has to do so before the finisher  Action Mailer has been updated to do that  x000D \n x000D \n  Applications using  bootsnap  have to upgrade to 1 4 0  x000D \n x000D \n   Backwards incompatibility x000D \n x000D \nIn   classic  mode there is no change  If Zeitwerk is enabled  x000D \n x000D \n  For files below the standard  concerns  directories  like  app models concerns     Concerns  cannot be a namespace  That is   app models concerns geolocatable rb  is expected to define  Geolocatable   not  Concerns  Geolocatable   x000D \n x000D \n  A file should define only one constant in its namespace  but can define inner ones   So  if  app models foo rb  defines  Foo  and also  Bar    Bar  won t be reloaded cleanly  You can have inner constants  so  Foo  may define an auxiliary internal class  Foo  Woo   x000D \n x000D \n  A file that defines a class or module that acts as a namespace  needs to define the class or module using the  class  and  module  keywords  For example  if you have  app models hotel rb  defining the  Hotel  class  and  app models hotel pricing rb  defining a mixin for hotels  the  Hotel  class must be defined with  class   you cannot do  Hotel   Class new          or  Hotel   Struct new          or anything like that  Those idioms are fine in classes and modules that do not act as namespaces  x000D \n x000D \n  Once the application has booted  autoload paths are frozen  x000D \n x000D \n  Autoload paths that do not exist on boot are ignored  x000D \n x000D \n   Future work x000D \n x000D \nI believe the patch is in good shape for a beta  For final  I ll work on documentation  In particular  the  Autoloading and Reloading Constants  https   guides rubyonrails org autoloading and reloading constants html  needs a complete revision  x000D \n x000D \nThere are some  if RUBY ENGINE     ruby   and  config autoloader     zeitwerk  here and there  I ll try to encapsulate them somehow  x000D \n", "annotation": {"notes": "", "label": ["statement"]}, "extras": "null", "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1, "last_updated_at": 1, "sec_taken": 0, "last_updated_by":

{"content": "  Guides aren t really meant to have a timeline in them  They re a record of what has happened  not what is going to be happen  x000D \n x000D \nWhen I type  rails 6  in Google  the link https   edgeguides rubyonrails org 6 0 release notes html is second in a list  The article is linked from many other Rails 6 articles  The point is that this is not an obscure text somewhere on The Dark Web   it is a text that many people read in order to see details about Rails 6  I was one of those people  And I was totally confused by the information presented  Imagine the typical confusions of a normal person  who is not active in Rails development community   x000D \n   Why so little info  Oh  apparently Rails 6 is not released yet    So why can t this article clearly say on the very top of the page that Rails 6 and this documentation are a work in progress  It s irritating having to Google separately for this info   x000D \n   Ok  the Rails 6 is a work in progress  the list of features is not yet complete   I understand all that  But why can t this article have at least something   even some simple mentions on what is upcoming  on what features were already decided to be included   x000D \n   Rails 6 is work in progress  But why isn t here any info about the timeline in the main document that describes this milestone  Until the release  info about the dates are the most important info one needs  the need for features compatibility documentation comes after the need for a timeline  everything else becomes important even later on   Do I really have to be an active part of the Rails development community in order to get a simple answer  Do I really need to start reading blogs just to see some glimpses and guestimations about the possible release dates  Looks totally excessive    I wish this important info was right here and there would be a volunteer  who would bother to make such changes     x000D \n x000D \n x000D \nRails 6 will be one of the biggest releases yet  Cool changes to Rails should be actively promoted  it s not like Rails has been winning the Web competition even against Python   The documentation page is an essential part of Rails s marketing  It should be used to the fullest  even if the info written is there only temporarily and will be deleted after the release  The fact that this info will be there for a year  informing the very people interested in the release  is more than enough to make an effort to make proposed changes worth it  x000D \n x000D \nIf you still disagree  then  this page  https   edgeguides rubyonrails org 6 0 release notes html  should be closed from public view  I would prefer not to  but for the sake of consistency this must be done  The link should start working publicly only after the release since the article should tell only about stuff that has already happened  If I will make this suggestion can I count on your approval support  x000D \n x000D \n x000D \n  Let s wait for Action Text and Action Mailbox to be merged into Rails before we write about them   x000D \nThe decision to include both was already made  x000D \n  https   weblog rubyonrails org 2018 10 3 introducing action text for rails 6  x000D \n  https   weblog rubyonrails org 2018 12 13 introducing action mailbox for rails 6  x000D \nBoth posts were written by the DHH himself  on Rails s official web site  This is as close to the actual merge as one gets  x000D \n x000D \nThe Release Notes page for Rails 6 are  Work in progress   So why isn t work on it allowed  x000D \n    https   user images githubusercontent com 2521942 50098587 e8d71a00 0224 11e9 9d46 2e2b85fbdb65 png  x000D \n x000D \nSo why to wait  Why to leave things until the last moment  Why to leave it until the crunch time  I am sure that during the release window there will be plenty of other important things to do  admittedly much more technically difficult than what I am doing here  so why not let competent people do the difficult stuff  while I am helping with this kind of important  minutiae    Why can t I help a little bit  now that I have time and motivation  to help other people  here and now  that are searching for the relevant information  x000D \n x000D \nMarketing   selling ideas to people  This usually means having to go where the people customers are  Rails is in a very fortunate situation that it has people who come to the aforementioned page in order to be  sold   the idea that Rails 6 will be an awesome release  that Rails is in good hands and is a viable option for development   This opportunity is not used  I had a modest proposal of at least closing the most glaring hole and getting at least some kind of benefit from all the current visitors  who at this moment and until the release will simply waste their time visiting the page and learn absolutely nothing about the main topic of the article   x000D \n x000D \n x000D \nI sincerely hope that you will reconsider your decision  x000D \n x000D
